## 💡 Why This Project?

I wanted to create a unique and memorable portfolio that stands out from traditional single-page websites. By recreating the familiar Windows 11 interface, visitors get an engaging and fun experience while exploring my skills, projects, and resume.

This project showcases modern web development skills including state management, component architecture, responsive design, and attention to detail in UI/UX.
